## About Me

Hi, my name is Aaron Earl and I am a senior at Western Oregon university. Currently I am majoring in Computer Science and am working on a minor in Entreprenuership. I plan to graduate in Fall 2018 or spring 2019 depending on scheduling. I am currently interning at Intel in the Engineering Computing department. It has be fortunate because I have gotten a great headstart on the material for this class, learning things like Jira, Agile, and Git team management. I am looking forward to this school year and looking forward to graduating!

## Homework 1

I'll have to admit HTML and web design is not my strongest talent. I have really been trying to learn this and I kept putting it off until now. Luckily I was doing some similar things at work for a couple of weeks but I still have tons to learn about this stuff. I really have trouble with the boostrap containers and column system. I still haven't gotten that portion to work.
