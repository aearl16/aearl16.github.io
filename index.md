# Welcome to My Github Page!

This will be my main page for CS460 and to be used for my portfolio.

## About Me

Hi, my name is Aaron Earl and I am a senior at Western Oregon university. Currently I am majoring in Computer Science and am working on a minor in Entreprenuership. I plan to graduate in Fall 2018 or spring 2019 depending on scheduling. I am currently interning at Intel in the Engineering Computing department. It has be fortunate because I have gotten a great headstart on the material for this class, learning things like Jira, Agile, and Git team management. I am looking forward to this school year and looking forward to graduating!

## Homework 1

I'll have to admit HTML and web design is not my strongest talent. I have really been trying to learn this and I kept putting it off until now. Luckily I was doing some similar things at work for a couple of weeks but I still have tons to learn about this web related things. I really have trouble with the boostrap containers and column system. Partucularly with alignments and styling.

All of the work for this assignment can be found here: [My Website Repo](https://github.com/aearl16/CS460_Web)

## Homework 2

This will be my first experience programming javascript. It doesn't seem that difficult but it is always a challenge learning a new language. I decided to play with some drag and drop items. I got it working but couldn't figure out how to align it perfectly. I used the document model and checkboxed to allow which elements could be draggable.

    Note: I didn't add this page to my main webpage (mostly because its ugly). It only exists in the repo.

## Homework 3

 Conversion of a Java postfix calculator to C#. This project was really interested to do without Java like libraries. I took several approaches to slove the problem and managed to make the conversion.
