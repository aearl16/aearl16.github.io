# Welcome to My Github Page!

This will be my main page for CS460 and to be used for my portfolio.

## About Me

Hi, my name is Aaron Earl and I am a senior at Western Oregon university. Currently I am majoring in Computer Science and am working on a minor in Entreprenuership. I plan to graduate in Fall 2018 or spring 2019 depending on scheduling. I am currently interning at Intel in the Engineering Computing department. It has be fortunate because I have gotten a great headstart on the material for this class, learning things like Jira, Agile, and Git team management. I am looking forward to this school year and looking forward to graduating!

## Homework 1

I'll have to admit HTML and web design is not my strongest talent. I have really been trying to learn this and I kept putting it off until now. Luckily I was doing some similar things at work for a couple of weeks but I still have tons to learn about this web related things. I really have trouble with the boostrap containers and column system. Partucularly with alignments and styling.

All of the work for this assignment can be found here: [My Website Repo](https://github.com/aearl16/CS460_Web)

## Homework 2

This will be my first experience programming javascript. It doesn't seem that difficult but it is always a challenge learning a new language. I decided to play with some drag and drop items. I got it working but couldn't figure out how to align it perfectly. I used the document model and checkboxed to allow which elements could be draggable.

    Note: I didn't add this page to my main webpage (mostly because its ugly). It only exists in the repo.

## Homework 3

 Conversion of a Java postfix calculator to C#. This project was really interested to do without Java like libraries. I took several approaches to slove the problem and managed to make the conversion.

## Homework 4

Homwork 4 was an introduction to MVC and Razor. I found MVC a little difficult to understand especially without models. The interactions between peices seemed a little strange. There is definetly a great deal of functionality in MVC vs other frameworks I have worked with.

## Homework 5

Homework 5 is a form with a simple virtual DB attatched. This lab will be a challenge as there are multiple pieces to manage. They way I understand it, is that you create a simple database with SQL, upload it to your local server (your machine), and then operate on it from there. The context and model help with this to add a table and fields.

## Homework 5

Homework 6 introduced a complex database with lots of moving parts. We would be concentrating on the Product portion of the database, generating models, and context for accessing the content in the database. The database was AdventureWorks 2014 from a backup files. From there a webpage was made to display categories and subcategories of products. They a product could be selected from a subcategory and then have its details displayed.
